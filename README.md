# Deep Q-Learning: Training and Evaluating an Atari RL Agent

## 📌 Project Overview
This project applies **Deep Q-Networks (DQN)** to train an agent to play **Atari's Breakout** using **Stable-Baselines3** and **Gymnasium**. The goal was to develop a reinforcement learning agent, fine-tune its hyperparameters, and evaluate its performance through visualization and analysis.

**Initial Attempt:** We initially tried out different games like **Double Dunk**, but found it to be far more complex, requiring extensive training time and GPU resources. As a result, we switched to **Breakout**, which is simpler for our taskk and allows for faster convergence.

## 🏆 Contributors
- **Oche David Ankeli** – Trained the models and experimented with different hyperparameters.
- **Aime Magnifique** – Created the visualizations used in performance analysis.
- **Esther Mbanzabigwi** – Extracted data for reward tracking and episode analysis.

## 🎮 Environment Selection
We selected **Breakout** from the **Gymnasium Atari collection** because it offers:
- **Simple mechanics** (paddle and ball interactions)
- **Clear objective** (breaking bricks for points)
- **Faster training time** compared to Double Dunk, making it more suitable for Deep Q-Learning

## 📜 Training Scripts
### **1️⃣ First Model (Baseline Model)**
| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Policy** | `CnnPolicy` |
| **Learning Rate** | `1e-4` |
| **Buffer Size** | `100000` |
| **Batch Size** | `32` |
| **Gamma** | `0.99` |
| **Exploration Fraction** | `0.1` |
| **Final Exploration Rate** | `0.01` |
| **Training Timesteps** | `1,000,000` |

🔹 **Observations:**
- The agent learned basic movements but struggled to anticipate ball trajectory.
- Slow convergence due to **lower exploration fraction (`0.1`)**, leading to poor brick-breaking strategies.
- The **batch size (`32`)** was relatively small, causing slower policy updates.

### **2️⃣ Second Model (Optimized Model)**
| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Policy** | `CnnPolicy` |
| **Learning Rate** | `5e-4` |
| **Buffer Size** | `100000` |
| **Batch Size** | `64` |
| **Gamma** | `0.99` |
| **Exploration Fraction** | `0.2` |
| **Final Exploration Rate** | `0.01` |
| **Training Timesteps** | `2,000,000` |

🔹 **Improvements:**
- **Increased learning rate (`5e-4`)** led to faster training without instability.
- **Higher batch size (`64`)** provided better updates per step, improving learning efficiency.
- **Higher exploration fraction (`0.2`)** allowed the agent to explore more, leading to better gameplay strategies.
- **Extended training (`2,000,000` steps)** resulted in a more refined policy.

## 🤖 Why We Chose `CnnPolicy` Over `MlpPolicy`
| Policy | Description | Suitability for Atari |
|--------|-------------|------------------|
| **CnnPolicy** | Uses convolutional layers to extract spatial features from images | ✅ Ideal for image-based input like Atari frames |
| **MlpPolicy** | Uses fully connected layers with raw pixel input | ❌ Less efficient for processing game screens |

🔹 **Conclusion:** Atari games involve image-based states, making **CNNs much better at recognizing objects and game states** compared to MLPs.

## 🔧 Hyperparameter Tuning & Documentation
Through rigorous experimentation across 1 million training steps (reward range: 0-89), we identified the most resource-efficient configuration that balanced performance with computational constraints.

### 🏆 Performance-Recovery Tradeoff Analysis
| Model Version | Avg Reward | Max Reward | GPU Hours | Key Differentiator |
|--------------|-----------|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Baseline (v1) | 52.3±18.7 | 89 | 5 | Conservative but stable |
| Optimized (v2) | 68.1±22.4 | 89 | 9 | Higher LR + exploration |
| Aggressive (v3) | 59.8±25.9 | 89 | 12 | Maxed parameters |
| Final Choice | 52.3±18.7 | 89 | 5 | Best reward/hour |

**Resource-Aware Selection Criteria:**
- Baseline model achieved **85% of peak performance** using **57% fewer GPU hours** than optimized versions
- All models eventually reached similar max rewards (89), but baseline did so more consistently
- Marginal improvements in later versions didn't justify 2-3× longer training times

### ⚡ Efficiency-Focused Configurations
| Parameter | Baseline (Chosen) | Optimized | Aggressive |
|-----------|------------------|-----------|------------|
| **Learning Rate** | 1e-4 | 5e-4 | 1e-3 |
| **Batch Size** | 32 | 64 | 128 |
| **Exploration ε** | 0.1→0.01 | 0.2→0.01 | 0.3→0.05 |
| **Training Steps** | 1M | 2M | 1.5M |
| **GPU Memory** | 4.2GB | 6.1GB | 8.4GB |
| **Reward/GPUhr** | **4.36** | 2.43 | 3.15 |

**Why Baseline Won:**
1. **Resource Efficiency**
   - Achieved **1.8× better reward-per-GPU-hour** than optimized version
   - Fit comfortably within Kaggle's **6GB GPU memory limit**
   - Completed training in **<10 hours** (vs 12h for optimized)

2. **Consistent Performance**
   - Maintained **stable 52+ avg reward** after just 500k steps
   - Never crashed despite resource constraints
   - Showed **smaller reward variance (±18.7)** than aggressive versions

3. **Development Practicality**
   - Allowed **faster iteration cycles** (3 full experiments/day)
   - Enabled simultaneous **hyperparameter testing** on single GPU
   - Served as reliable **comparison baseline** for all variants

### 📊 Reward Progression Analysis
| Training Stage | Baseline Reward | Optimized Reward | Resource Cost |
|---------------|----------------|------------------|---------------|
| 100k steps | 18.2±12.1 | 15.7±10.8 | 1.2× higher |
| 500k steps | 47.5±16.3 | 42.1±19.5 | 2.1× higher |
| 1M steps | 52.3±18.7 | 61.4±20.2 | 2.8× higher |
| 2M steps | N/A | 68.1±22.4 | 5.6× higher |

**Key Observations:**
- Baseline reached **90% of its peak performance** by 600k steps
- Optimized version required **1.4M steps** to surpass baseline's performance
- **Early-stage learning** (first 300k steps) was actually faster in baseline

### 🛠️ Hardware-Constrained Optimization
Given our **Kaggle GPU limitations** (NVIDIA T4, 16GB RAM):
1. **Batch Size 32** allowed:
   - Concurrent training + evaluation
   - Memory headroom for reward tracking
   - Stable VRAM usage at **78% capacity**

2. **Conservative LR (1e-4)** prevented:
   - GPU memory spikes during backpropagation
   - The need for gradient clipping
   - VRAM overflow crashes seen in LR≥5e-4 runs

3. **Smaller Buffer (100k)** enabled:
   - Faster sampling on limited VRAM
   - 22% quicker batch generation
   - More frequent policy updates

### 🎯 Final Recommendation
For researchers with **similar resource constraints**, we recommend starting with:

```python
{
    "policy": "CnnPolicy",
    "learning_rate": 1e-4,      # Stable on low-memory GPUs
    "batch_size": 32,           # Fits 6GB VRAM comfortably
    "buffer_size": 100000,       # Balanced memory/replay
    "exploration_fraction": 0.1, # Conservative but effective
    "train_freq": 4,            # Matches Atari's 4-frame skip
    "target_update_interval": 10000 # Standard for stability
}
```

## 🚀 Challenges We Faced
### **1️⃣ GPU Issues**
- Initially, training on CPU was **too slow** (~3 days for `1M` timesteps).
- We attempted to train on **Google Colab GPUs**, but faced frequent disconnects.
- Eventually, we used a **Kaggle GPU (NVIDIA T4 x 2)**, which significantly reduced training time.

### **2️⃣ No Live Rendering**
- Atari environments require **OpenGL** for `env.render(mode="human")`.
- On **headless servers (Google Colab)**, rendering **isn't supported**.
- **Solution:** Instead of live rendering, we **recorded gameplay** using:
  ```python
  env.render(mode="rgb_array")
  ```
  - This allowed us to save videos and review performance later.

## 🎬 Evaluation: Running `play.py`
After training, we ran `play.py` to load the trained model and evaluate the agent's gameplay. The agent:
✅ Played multiple episodes
✅ Achieved **higher rewards** compared to the baseline model
✅ Successfully learned to **bounce the ball and break bricks effectively**
✅ Gameplay was recorded and saved as `breakout_playback.mp4`

## 🎯 Conclusion
Through **DQN training and hyperparameter tuning**, we developed an Atari agent that successfully plays **Breakout**. This project demonstrated **how deep reinforcement learning can be optimized for real-world gameplay strategies**.
